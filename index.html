   <br><br>Apple was created by 2 guys called Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Apple was named apple <br>
   becuse Steve Jobs liked apples. Apple's first computer was called the apple 1. It costed <br>
   was the Apple 1. It costed 666 dollars when it was first released, but now its around 2500 dollars.

   <br>
 After the apple 1, came the apple 2 and 3. Five years later in 1985, Steve Jobs was fired from apple. <br>
A year earlier in 1984, the first macintoch came out which ended up to be a faliure which made the company <br>
 loose lots of money. 14 years later, in 1999 came the iBook clamshell which was a success and made the <br>
   company rise! After the iBook came the macbook in 2006 and discontinued later in 2012 because apple <br>
   the macbook pro, air and new iMac which is a desktop computer. those 3 sold better than the origional <br>
   macbook. Now we'll go back to 2009 when the first iPhone was released which was a huge success. Then <br>
   Apple decided to release followups like the iPhone 4 and 4s and later came the 5, 6, 7 and 8.
 <br>
 <br>
    In 2017 the iPhone X came out celebrating the iPhone's 10th anniversary. Everyone expected the iphone 9 <br>
 but instead we got the X which had a huge design change which removed the home button and added face <br>
 recognition. In 2019, the airpods pro came out with the iPhone 11. Apple released a follow up version <br>
 of the airpods in 2020 called the airpods max which were quite expensive coming in at 540 dollars which is <br>
 around 200BD. Apple released the airtag in 2021 which is a tracking device which was a huge hit. And finally, <br>
 in 2022 apple released the iphone 14, the latest iphone which came with the re added plus models, a redisign <br>
 of the notch and 48 megapixel cameras. And now in 2023 apple is worth about 2trillion dollars which is <br>
 actually bigger than the GDP of lots of countries like Portugal, Spain and Russia.
